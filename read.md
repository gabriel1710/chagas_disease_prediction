Chagas Disease prediction

In this study, we developed machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of Chagas disease based on five general factors: age, gender, history of living in a mud or wooden house, history of being bitten by a triatomine bug, and family history of Chagas disease. We utilized data from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) to train five machine learning algorithms. The sample comprised 2,006 patients, divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing algorithm performance. We evaluated the model's precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics.
